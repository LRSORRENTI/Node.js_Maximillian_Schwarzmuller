=============
USING NODEMON
=============

Nodemon is a utility tool, it allows 
for running of our application while 
also watching our file for changes, and 
will restart the process for us if we do 
make changes 

We can also alter the "start" script in the 
package.json to: 

"start": "nodemon app.js" 

This is crucial if nodemon is not installed globally


In the last lecture, we added nodemon as a
 local dependency to our project.

The good thing about local dependencies 
is that you can share projects without
 the node_modules folder (where they are stored) 
 and you can run npm install in a 
 project to then re-create that node_modules
  folder. 
  
  This allows you to share only your 
  source code, hence reducing the size 
  of the shared project vastly.

The attached course code snippets 
also are shared in that way, hence 
you need to run npm install in the 
extracted packages to be able to run my code!

I showed that nodemon app.js would 
not work in the terminal or command 
line because we don't use local dependencies
 there but global packages.

You could install nodemon globally
 if you wanted (this is NOT required
  though - because we can just run it
   locally): npm install -g nodemon would
    do the trick. Specifically the -g flag
     ensures that the package gets added 
     as a global package which you now can 
     use anywhere on your machine,
      directly from inside the terminal 
      or command prompt.
