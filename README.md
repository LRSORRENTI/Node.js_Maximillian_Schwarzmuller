Description
Join the most comprehensive Node.js course on Udemy and learn Node in both a practical as well as theory-based way!

---

This course was updated to also include sections on Deno.js - in addition to more than 30 hours of content on Node.js!

Node.js is probably THE most popular and modern server-side programming language you can dive into these days!

Node.js developers are in high demand and the language is used for everything from traditional web apps with server-side rendered views over REST APIs all the way up to GraphQL APIs and real-time web services. Not to mention its applications in build workflows for projects of all sizes.

This course will teach you all of that! From scratch with zero prior knowledge assumed. Though if you do bring some knowledge, you'll of course be able to quickly jump into the course modules that are most interesting to you.

Here's what you'll learn in this course:

Node.js Basics & Basic Core Modules

Parsing Requests & Sending Responses

Rendering HTML Dynamically (on the Server)

Using Express.js

Working with Files and generating PDFs on the Server (on-the-fly)

File Up- and Download

Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

Using Node.js with SQL (MySQL) and Sequelize

Using Node.js with NoSQL (MongoDB) and Mongoose

Working with Sessions & Cookies

User Authentication and Authorization

Sending E-Mails

Validating User Input

Data Pagination

Handling Payments with Stripe.js

Building REST APIs

Authentication in REST APIs

File Upload in REST APIs

Building GraphQL APIs

Authentication in GraphQL APIs

File Upload in GraphQL APIs

Building a Realtime Node.js App with Websockets

Automated Testing (Unit Tests)

Deploying a Node.js Application

Using TypeScript with Node.js

Exploring Deno.js

And Way More!

Does this look like a lot of content? It certainly is!

This is not a short course but it is the "Complete Guide" on Node.js after all. We'll dive into a lot of topics and we'll not just scratch the surface.

We'll also not just walk through boring theory and some slides. Instead, we'll build two major projects: An online shop (including checkout + payments) and a blog.

All topics and features of the course will be shown and used in these projects and you'll therefore learn about them in a realistic environment.



Is this course for you?

If you got no Node.js experience, you'll love this course because it starts with zero knowledge assumed. It's the perfect course to become a Node.js developer.

If you got basic Node.js experience, this course is also a perfect match because you can go through the basic modules quickly and you'll benefit from all the deep dives and advanced topics the course covers.

Are you an advanced Node.js user? Check the curriculum then. Maybe you found no other course that shows how to use SQL with Node.js. Or you're interested in GraphQL. Chances are, that you'll get a lot of value out of this course, too!



Prerequisites

NO Node.js knowledge is required at all!

NO other programming language knowledge (besides JavaScript, see next point) is required

Basic JavaScript knowledge is assumed though - you should at least be willing to pick it up whilst going through the course. A JS refresher module exists to bring you up to the latest syntax quickly

Basic HTML + CSS knowledge helps but is NOT required

Who this course is for:
Beginner or advanced web developers who want to dive into backend (server-side) development with NodeJS
Everyone who's interested in building modern, scalable and high-performing web applications
Experienced NodeJS developers who want to dive into specific features like using GraphQL with NodeJS
