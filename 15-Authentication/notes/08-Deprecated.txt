====================
csurf() alternatives
====================

Unfortunately, the csurf package, 
which is used in some sections of this course,
is no longer maintained at this time.

 The development team recently deprecated 
 this popular package, saying that it should
  no longer be used 
  (https://github.com/expressjs/csurf#deprecated).

The purpose of the corresponding course
 lectures is to explain the general
  principle of CSRF attacks.
  
   You can still safely use
    the deprecated package
     for learning purposes,
      since attacks are only
       simulated locally in our code.

However, in practice you
 should now choose a 
 different package
  (https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=express%20csrf).
  
   You may, for example,
    consider using this package 
    (which has a different API than
     csurf()): https://www.npmjs.com/package/csrf-csrf.

Please understand that support
 in this course currently still
  focuses on the csurf API,
  as shown in the course 
  videos and code snapshots.

And most importantly,
 the general principle 
 explained in this course 
 is package independent.
